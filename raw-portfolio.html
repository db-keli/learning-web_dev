            <summary><b>Read About My Journey As A Programmer</b></summary>
            <br>
            From a young age, my fascination with technology led me to join the robotics team in high school. It was there that I discovered my passion for programming and embarked on a journey of exploration and learning. Eager to delve deeper, I ventured into the realm of Linux and Unix, familiarizing myself with their intricacies. With a particular affinity for robotics and Arduino programming, I found myself naturally gravitating towards C++ and C, honing my skills in this versatile language.
            As my knowledge and enthusiasm grew, I chose to pursue a degree in electrical and electronics engineering, where I could immerse myself in the exciting world of IoT. Fuelled by a desire to broaden my horizons, I independently embarked on a journey of self-learning in machine learning, recognizing its immense potential in shaping the future of technology.
            Recognizing the importance of well-rounded expertise, I also enrolled in a software engineering program, determined to strengthen my abilities in designing robust and efficient software solutions. This dual focus on hardware and software provides me with a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between the two, equipping me with the tools to tackle complex technological challenges.
            As I continue to learn and grow, my passion for technology remains unwavering. Driven by curiosity and a relentless desire to innovate, I am eager to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology, creating solutions that harness the power of machine learning, IoT, and software engineering. With a solid foundation in robotics, programming, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I am poised to make a significant impact in the tech industry, shaping a future where technology seamlessly integrates into our lives.

            <h3>My Projects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Fingerprint Attendance System</b>
                    <p>
                        Contributed to a team's final year project where we built a Fingerprint Attendance System
                        that uses the RFID and a fingerprint sensor to verify student attendance. This system came with a
                        web application where students could enroll courses and lecturers could access a data of their attendance
                        each day. Using Streamlit I contributed to preparing the data and building of the web application. I also contributed
                        to the electronics of the system using the ESP32.

                    <b>Personal Git Automation Script</b>
                    <p>
                        Git Ease is a personal git automation which makes using version control whilst working on projects with lots of files
                        easier. It is written in Bash. It can be used to stage, commit and push all files or specific files in just one command.
                        Git Ease is still will love to have contributions to make it better.
